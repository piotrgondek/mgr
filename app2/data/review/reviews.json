    "content": "This is a review I expect to update as I continue to use my brand new Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 lens. I am not a super-technical pixel-peeper kind of guy but I am a pretty experienced photographer and I'm writing this with a similar audience in mind. I bought this lens because I do a lot of event photography, especially dance (doing volunteer work for a ballet company) and while I've done pretty well with my trusty Canon 24-70mm F2.8 lens, I've felt a bit (sometimes more than a bit) limited when I photograph fast moving dance sequences in the low-light environments stage and dance very often are. That's because the 24-70mm F2.8 simply doesn't do as well on an EOS 7D with its 1.6x (APS-C) crop that it does on a full-frame like my EOS 5D Mark III. That's what's one of the very nice things about this lens. You get the same performance on the crop body with it that you get with the 24-70mm on the full-frame. And that's important because my crop body with its 8 frame per second burst capability is the best camera for catching action (as opposed to the significantly smaller burst capability of the 5D Mark III).",

  { "content": "There are several in depth reviews available so I just wanted to add a few impressions after using this lens compared to to my Canon 17-55mm f2.8 IS lens since the two lenses might be competing for a spot in someone's camera bag.  Advantages of the 18-35mm: Both are sharp lenses but the ~8-35mm may have the edge. While the 17-55mm has IS, I prefer the wider aperture since it is also helpful for moving subjects and can provide shallower depth of field. The build quality of the 18-35mm is awesome and I love that the zoom is all internal. I worry sometimes when carrying my 17-55mm from a strap and it is swinging around with the zoom extended.",
